# The Twelve Project

The 12 project is an attempt to build myself 12 different home pages from scratch over the course of the 12 months of 2021. 

## Description

The goal is to track my growth progress while giving myself a tangible portfolio to show others what a year of part-time training can give in terms of growth potential.
